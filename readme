                     Uconvfix2 v1.130924.

This wrapper library is inspired by uconvfix from OS/2 ACPI team.
Their uconvfix is very optimistic and releases the protecting spinlock only
after correct return from the IBM uconv code. Unfortunately starting from second
passing of unsupported code page this code hangs or GPFs. In this case uconvfix
keeps spinlock in owned state forever and other uconv clients like JFS
effectively hang as well. This implementation uses system shared mutex facility
and at least should not produce additional hangs.

Installation:
* This package includes ucv32.dll - it's renamed uconv.dll,
your original uconv.dll should be equal to renamed.
* backup original uconv.dll
* copy uconv.dll usv32.dll to the directory of original uconv.dll


        Testcases to show the problem of uconv and uconfix.

Hang:
- Run File Commander and enter to text file editor;
- Alt+C, codepage 999. This causes "Invalid code page" error window;
- Another Alt+C, codepage 999. Hang inside IBM uconv.dll.

GPF:
- Run File Commander and enter to text file editor;
- Alt+C, codepage 1251. This passes;
- Another Alt+C, codepage 999. GPF inside IBM uconv.dll.


Change log:
1.130924:
- Added serialization of _UniMalloc and _UniFree to the same mutex because they
  are called simultaneously from Uconv allocation functions and from the
  external IBM locale library

1.130221:
- Initial public version
